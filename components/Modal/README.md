# Disclaimer on Modals

Dear Future Traveler,

These two modal types (`ModalDialog` and `ModalGeneric`) are very similar in many ways and could stand to be DRY'd out since they share some nearly-identical code. I wrote them this way initially given some complexities in how they interact with the game mechanics and due to time constraints, I was unable to abstract them together to be cleaner and support more extensive reuse. My apologies. Please don't judge me...

Love,
